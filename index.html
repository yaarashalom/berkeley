    Berkeley the pup was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" target="_blank">Jerusalem</a>, where he was also adopted by his mommy and daddy.
    After his parents graduated from university, he moved to Tel Aviv with them.
    Then, when the two decided London does in fact wait for them, they moved the poor pup to dreary England.
